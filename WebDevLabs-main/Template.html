                    In the early years of the 1700s, there was a shift toward a new style now known as Rococo.

                    The Palace of Versailles is a royal chateau that was once
                    the center of politcal power, located in Versailles, France (12 miles west 
                    of Paris, France). The former residence of King Louis XIV, was 
                    abandoned by the aristocracy, who once again took up residence 
                    in Paris. 
                <br> <br>

                    <strong>
                    A shift away from the monarchy, toward the aristocracy characterizes the art of this 
                    period.
                    </strong>
                <br><br>

                    France was the center of the development of Rococo.
                <br>

                    In design, 
                    <strong>the salon,</strong> 
                    a room for entertaining but also impressing guests, 
                    was a major innovation.

                <br>
        Rococo salons are characterized by their <strong>elaborate detail, 
        intricate patterns, serpentine design work, asymmetry, and a 
        predisposition to lighter, pastel, and gold-based color palettes.</strong>
                <br><br>

        The most famous example was Charles-
        Joseph Natoire and Germain Boffrand's <i>La Salon de la Princesse</i>
        in the residence of the Prince and Princess de Soubise.
                <br>
        Asymmetrical curves, sometimes derived from organic forms, such as 
        seashells were elaborate and exaggerated. 
        Minimal emphasis was placed on architecture and maximum 
        emphasis on d√©cor is essential to the Rococo movement.
